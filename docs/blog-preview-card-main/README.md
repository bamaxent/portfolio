## My process

### Built with

- VSCode
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Variables
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Silktide Accessibility Checker & Screen Reader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/silktide-accessibility-ch/mpobacholfblmnpnfbiomjkecoojakah)
- [Fluid-responsive property calculator](https://websemantics.uk/tools/fluid-responsive-property-calculator/)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)


### What I learned

- Not everything has to be calculated fluid-responsive `clamp()` methods, but can simply be three variables (e.g. – `clamp(1rem, 2rem, 3rem)`).
- CSS `order` is more important than I realzied or used more than I thought to ensure proper flow with screen readers.
- I got to understand `aria-label` better and how to utilize it.
- I learned about `place-items` (i.e. – `place-items: center`).
- I learned how to use `@font-face` and `font-display: swap`.

### Continued development

- Need to contiunue honing my skills with CSS grid (`minmax`, understanding shorthand like `grid-template` versus using both `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` )
 - Need to contiunue honing my skills with CSS flexbox (especially "main axis" and "cross axis" alignment).
