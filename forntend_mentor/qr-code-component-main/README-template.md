## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Handcoded custom HTML & CSS properties
- VS Code

### What I learned

That when styling elements you don't always have to you `clamp()` functions and variables, especially for a simple project like this. Simply trying to get the finish build product to look identical to design for this challenge.

### Continued development

Think more semanitcally and try to remember `flex` properties better based on `flex-position` (i.e. â€“ `align-items` vs `justify-content`).

And `vim`. I hate `vim`. Does anyone like `vim`?
